## Background

GPG (stands for Gnu Privacy Guard) is an implementation of PGP (which stands for Pretty Good Privacy), an open standard for encryption specified by [RFC 4880](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4880). In this post, we'll build up a program in Rust that implements one part of the PGP standard, verifying cleartext signatures.

_(As an aside, I think it's hilarious that GPG is an implementation of PGP. The obvious right choice was to call it GPGP. I considered calling my tool PGPG, but ultimately decided on pgp-rs, because I'm boring.)_
