goals:
  * generate key
  * import keys
  * generate encrypted message
  * decrypt message
  * sign message
  * verify signed message
  * completely compatible with gpg

start with RSA, consider other algorithms later. first thing to do,
generate large primes. use `num` crate to get bigint functionaltiy
(BigUint). it also has a random sampler, so that's easy. Use primality
testing (first basic testing against the first few primes, then fermat,
then miller/rabin) to determine whether the randomly generated number
is prime. Finally, parallelize prime generation with rayon (this was
particularly satisfying, the code changes were minimal, just switching
to use the `parallel` iterator, and the `find_any` combinator. the speedup
was immense, down from about 10 seconds to under 1 second for 1024 bit primes,
and down from 1-5 minutes to about 10 seconds for 2048 bit primes.)

for next time: nice loading bars for the terminal to show activity while
the primes are being generated, and actually generating the key from
the primes.

nice loading bars, let's use termprogress.

started by writing a quick test for the `is_probable_prime` function,
ended up finding a bug in my implementation because of my implementation
of gen_range, (generating numbers of BIT_SIZE and while looping if bigger)
found the RandBigInt trait which could do what I needed.

right now, just going to hard code an estimation time, figure out how
to actually estimate this later.

[next time] generate key, try to actually encrypt something

generated a key using the RSA procedure, thought I would have to write
gcd and extended_gcd, but they're provided by the num crate (in the Integer
trait). I suspect I'm still missing some nice functions that might make
my life easier.

then, wrote out the keys to a file using serde. for now, just json. eventually,
will actually produce keys in the pgp format.

[next time]
  * encrypt something
  * decrypt something
